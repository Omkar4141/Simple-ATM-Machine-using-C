# Simple-ATM-Machine-using-C

This mini project is based on c language.In this project we are having simple ATM(Automatic Teller Machine) which perform operation like<br>
1.Cheak Account Balance <br />
2.Withdraw Amount <br />
3.Deposit Amount.<br />
To achive these operations i have used basic concept of c language(Loops and Decision Control statements) and also to show time and date 
i have used Macros.The main motto behind making this project is to untilize knowledge of c after learning c language........
